# Contributing to Cypher GridPay Smart Contracts

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Cypher GridPay! We welcome contributions from the community to help build secure and reliable payment infrastructure on Stellar.

## 📜 Code of Conduct

This project follows the [Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). By participating, you are expected to uphold this code. Please report unacceptable behavior to the project maintainers.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have:
- Rust 1.74.0 or later
- Stellar CLI installed (`cargo install --locked stellar-cli --features opt`)
- Basic understanding of Soroban smart contracts
- Git for version control

### Development Setup

1. **Fork and clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/cypher-gridpay-contracts.git
   cd cypher-gridpay-contracts
   ```

2. **Add wasm target**
   ```bash
   rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown
   ```

3. **Build the contracts**
   ```bash
   make build
   ```

4. **Run tests**
   ```bash
   cargo test --workspace
   ```
### Makefile Targets

The root `Makefile` provides several helpful targets to streamline development. Run these using `make <target>`.

| Target | Description | When to Use |
|--------|-------------|-------------|
| `build` | Compiles the smart contracts using `stellar contract build` and checks the WASM sizes. | Use this whenever you want to compile your code and verify the output artifacts don't exceed size limits. |
| `test` | Runs the full `build` target, followed by `cargo test` to execute all tests. | Use this to verify that your contracts compile successfully and all tests pass. |
| `fmt` | Runs `cargo fmt --all` to format the workspace code. | Use this before committing to ensure your code adheres to standard Rust formatting guidelines. |
| `clean` | Runs `cargo clean` to remove the generated `target/` directory and build artifacts. | Use this to free up disk space or if you want to ensure a completely fresh build from scratch. |
| `check-size` | Checks the size of compiled `.wasm` artifacts against the `262144` bytes limit. | Runs automatically during `make build`. Use this manually if you just want to verify sizes without recompiling. |

### WASM Size Limit

Soroban networks enforce a maximum contract deployment size of **256 KB** (262,144 bytes). The `check-size` target enforces this limit to ensure contracts remain deployable on Stellar.

**Why this limit exists:** Soroban caps WASM blob size to keep ledger storage manageable and maintain network performance. A contract that exceeds it will be rejected at deployment by the Stellar network.

**If `make build` or `make check-size` fails with a size error:**

1. Check which contract exceeded the limit — the error message prints the file path and size.
2. **Build in release mode** — the default `stellar contract build` already compiles with optimizations.
3. **Strip debug symbols** — add `strip = true` to the release profile in `Cargo.toml`:
   ```toml
   [profile.release]
   strip = true
   ```
4. **Optimize for size** — add `opt-level = "z"` and `lto = true` in the release profile:
   ```toml
   [profile.release]
   opt-level = "z"
   lto = true
   ```
5. **Audit dependencies** — run `cargo bloat --crates` to identify large dependencies and consider lighter alternatives.
6. **Minimize contract exports** — only export the Soroban functions you need; avoid pulling in unused SDK features.
7. **Remove unused code** — use `cargo deadlinks` or review for dead code that the linker may still include.

After making changes, run `make build` to re-check the size.

### 🪝 Git Pre-Commit Hooks

To ensure that code is consistently formatted and passes compilation checks before committing, pre-commit hook configurations are provided:

#### Option A: Using `pre-commit` tool
Install the `pre-commit` package and install the hooks:
```bash
pip install pre-commit
pre-commit install
```
This automatically runs `cargo fmt --all -- --check` and `cargo check` across both `core` and `orchestrator` workspaces whenever you execute `git commit`.

#### Option B: Standalone shell script hook
If you prefer not to install Python's `pre-commit`, you can link the native hook script directly into your local git repository:
```bash
ln -sf ../../scripts/pre-commit.sh .git/hooks/pre-commit
chmod +x .git/hooks/pre-commit
```
To run the pre-commit checks manually at any time:
```bash
./scripts/pre-commit.sh
```

## 🔄 Development Workflow

### 1. Create a Feature Branch

```bash
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
# or
git checkout -b fix/bug-description
```

Branch naming conventions:
- `feature/` - New features
- `fix/` - Bug fixes
- `refactor/` - Code refactoring
- `docs/` - Documentation updates
- `test/` - Test additions or modifications

### 2. Make Your Changes

- Write clean, well-documented code
- Follow Rust best practices and idioms
- Add inline comments for complex logic
- Update or add tests for your changes

### 3. Write Tests

All contract changes **must** include tests:

```bash
# Test specific contract
cd contracts/payment
cargo test

# Test all contracts
cargo test --workspace
```

Test requirements:
- Unit tests for all public functions
- Integration tests for cross-contract interactions
- Edge case coverage
- Error handling verification

### 4. Format Your Code

```bash
make fmt
# or
cargo fmt --all
```

### 5. Run All Checks

Before committing, ensure:
```bash
# Format check
cargo fmt --all -- --check

# Build all contracts
make build

# Run all tests
cargo test --workspace

# Check for warnings
cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings
```

### 6. Commit Your Changes

Follow conventional commit format:

```bash
git commit -m "feat: add new payment validation"
git commit -m "fix: resolve escrow release issue"
git commit -m "test: add edge cases for refund processing"
git commit -m "docs: update payment contract documentation"
```

Commit message format:
- `feat:` - New feature
- `fix:` - Bug fix
- `refactor:` - Code refactoring
- `test:` - Adding or updating tests
- `docs:` - Documentation changes
- `chore:` - Maintenance tasks

### 7. Push and Create Pull Request

```bash
git push origin feature/your-feature-name
```

Then open a Pull Request on GitHub with:
- Clear description of changes
- Reference to related issues (if any)
- Screenshots/logs if applicable

## 📝 Code Style Guidelines

### Rust Conventions

- Follow the [Rust API Guidelines](https://rust-lang.github.io/api-guidelines/)
- Use descriptive variable and function names
- Keep functions focused and small
- Prefer explicit error handling over panics

### Soroban-Specific Guidelines

```rust
// ✅ Good: Clear function documentation
/// Creates a new payment with escrow
/// 
/// # Arguments
/// * `env` - Contract environment
/// * `from` - Sender address
/// * `amount` - Payment amount
/// 
/// # Panics
/// Panics if amount is zero
pub fn create_payment(env: Env, from: Address, amount: i128) -> u64 {
    // Implementation
}

// ❌ Avoid: Undocumented functions with unclear logic
pub fn cp(e: Env, f: Address, a: i128) -> u64 {
    // Implementation
}
```

### Testing Guidelines

```rust
#[test]
fn test_payment_creation() {
    let env = Env::default();
    // Setup test data
    let contract_id = env.register_contract(None, PaymentContract);
    
    // Execute test
    let payment_id = contract.create_payment(/* args */);
    
    // Verify results
    assert_eq!(payment_id, 1);
}

#[test]
#[should_panic(expected = "Amount must be positive")]
fn test_payment_creation_zero_amount() {
    // Test error cases
}
```

## 🔒 Security Considerations

Smart contracts handle real value. Please:

1. **Never bypass security checks** - All authorization checks are there for a reason
2. **Validate all inputs** - Check bounds, types, and authorization
3. **Test edge cases** - Zero amounts, maximum values, unauthorized access
4. **Consider reentrancy** - Ensure state updates happen before external calls
5. **Document security assumptions** - Explain trust boundaries in comments

## 🐛 Reporting Bugs

When reporting bugs, please include:

1. **Description** - Clear summary of the issue
2. **Steps to reproduce** - Detailed steps to trigger the bug
3. **Expected behavior** - What should happen
4. **Actual behavior** - What actually happens
5. **Environment** - Rust version, Stellar CLI version, OS
